This item should be quite simple!

- A paragraph about you - an interesting or fun thing about you and why you are 
    taking this class.
- Is there an item or topic in the syllabus that perks up your interest? If so, 
    please explain. Well, it’s also OK if you say ‘none.’   
- Is there an item not in the syllabus that you would like covered?

Paragraph(s), and not bullet style – no one liners please, thanks!

Hello, My name is Sidney. I'm a 5th-year undergrad here in Computer Science. My last 
year though, which is exciting! Something interesting about me is I love traveling 
and have driven across the country a couple of times. I love to cook and try new recipes.
  I'm really interested in getting into SQL and learning the language/commands.  Nothing 
  comes to mind when thinking about anything to add to the semester that isn't on the syllabus.
