This item should be quite simple!

- A paragraph about you - an interesting or fun thing about you and why you are 
    taking this class.
- Is there an item or topic in the syllabus that perks up your interest? If so, 
    please explain. Well, it’s also OK if you say ‘none.’   
- Is there an item not in the syllabus that you would like covered?

Paragraph(s), and not bullet style – no one liners please, thanks!

Hello, My name is Sidney. I'm a 5th year undergrad here for Computer Science. My last 
year though, which is exciting! Something interesting about me is .... idk 

I'm really interested in getting into sequal and learning the language/commands. 
Nothing comes to mind when thinking about anything to add to the semester that isnt on the syllabus that isnt already included.
