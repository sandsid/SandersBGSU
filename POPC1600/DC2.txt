Personalizing commercial products

Apply the ideas discussed in the green bean casserole article about personalization of popular culture 
to describe a commercial product that you have “made your own.” What kinds of variations have you made; 
has it inspired something entirely new? How do those variations express your personality and identity?

A dish that my family has that is similar to the green bean casserole is my mom's chicken and shredded 
potatoes.  It has a few similar ingredients to the casserole like the Campbells cream of mushroom, but it's 
made with shredded potatoes and chicken breast, cheese, and topped with the french's fried onions. My mom 
makes it with full chicken breasts on top of the shredded potatoes. I do it where I dice up the chicken 
breasts to small chunks which I think makes the chicken soak up more of the flavor making it super delicious!
I think the meal tastes a lot better with the new variation and makes it also a lot easier to serve as you
don't need to cut the breasts when dishing it out! I'm not sure where the recipe came from other than my mom's 
recipe book, but I think it does bring our family closer because it's our favorite meal to make and have 
together! I've made it for friends when we have had dinners together. I think it shows my personality because 
I like to make others happy and a good meal can do that very easily!
