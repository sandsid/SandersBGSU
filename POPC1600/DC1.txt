Hello, My name is Sidney. I'm from Hamilton Ohio but have lived in Bowling Green for going on 5 years now. 
I am a 5th-year undergrad working towards my Bachelor's in Computer Science.  The role of Pop culture to 
me is music, movies, and Tech. Music plays a very big role in my life, I listen to music anytime I'm not 
sleeping, in class, or at work. Music changes when I change, when emotions change within my life I listen 
to different genres of music. I usually listen to the Top hits at least once a week, familiarizing myself 
with what's popular at the current moment. With movies, I always try and keep up with Netflix's top 10 
movies/tv-shows as well. I always try to stay in the know of things changing around me as well. I'm a computer
science major so technology also plays a giant role in my life, I'm constantly reading articles on new 
developments.  My home is upgraded to include new tech everywhere, with smart devices and security cameras, I
like to know what's going on around me. Tech has changed a lot in a short amount of time and there's no 
slowing down, tech is definitely my favorite form of popular culture!
